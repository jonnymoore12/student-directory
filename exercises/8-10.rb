# Let's use chop() instead of chop()
# It worked exactly the same. However,
# !!!WARNING!!! chop will trim off the trailing character regarless of
# whether there was a \r or \n at the end or not. Chomp, only removes
# trailing \n or \r, so is generally preferable for this kind of use.

# You could also slice() your way along, passing in [0..-2]
